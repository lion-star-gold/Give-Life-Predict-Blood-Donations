# Give-Life-Predict-Blood-Donations
Code for my DataCamp project, 'Give Life: Predict Blood Donations'. A Guided project.

## Overall Description
The skills developed in DataCamp's 'Introduction to Predictive Analytics in Python', 'Preprocessing for Machine Learning in Python', and 'Data Manipulation with pandas' courses are used to manipulate data and carry out a model-building process. The dataset is inspected, and the ML pipeline is automated using tpot.

### Guided Project üìù
1. Inspecting transfusion.data file
2. Loading the blood donations data
3. Inspecting transfusion DataFrame
4. Creating target column
5. Checking target incidence
6. Splitting transfusion into train and test datasets
7. Selecting model using TPOT
8. Checking the variance
9. Log normalization
10. Training the logistic regression model
11. Conclusion
